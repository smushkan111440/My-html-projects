      <h3>About</h3>
      <p style="font-size:120%;">Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.Web development types have been classified into front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development. For an excellently interactive website or web app for your business, you need to have expert developers who are specialists in their calling.
      </p>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">These commonly include, but are not limited to:
      Developing front end website design.
      Understanding user interface and user experience design.
      Writing technical documentation.
      Designing website architecture.
      Implementing data security protocols.
      Creating servers and databases.
       </p>
       <h4>Front-end development</h4>
       <p style="font-size:120%;">
        Front-end development is the process of designing and implementing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application. It involves creating visually appealing and interactive elements that users interact with directly. The primary technologies and concepts associated with front-end development include:
        <h4>Back-end development</h4>
        <p style="font-size:120%;">Back-end development involves building the server-side logic and database components of a web application. It is responsible for processing user requests, managing data, and ensuring the overall functionality of the application. Key aspects of back-end development include:
        </p>
          <h4>Full-stack development</h4>
          <p style="font-size:120%;"> Full-stack development refers to the practice of designing, building, and maintaining the entire software stack of a web application. This includes both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) components, as well as the database and any other necessary infrastructure. A full-stack developer is someone who has expertise in working with both the frontend and backend technologies, allowing them to handle all aspects of web application development.
MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) are popular full-stack development stacks that streamline the development process by providing a cohesive set of technologies.
